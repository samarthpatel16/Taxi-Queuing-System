# Taxi-Queuing-System (Object oriented programming)


Let us talk about how first in first out system works.

First In, First Out, commonly known as FIFO, is an asset-management and valuation method in which assets produced or acquired first are sold, used, or disposed of first. 

This program is a simple c++ program which is a taxi queuing system. 

Each and every taxi which comes first will go first. 

We want to maintain queue of taxis at train station.

The queue implements a first-in-first out policy for taxis.

-> The taxi that came to the staion earliest (among all waiting taxis) is at the front of the queue.

-> The taxi at the front of the queue is the next one to be dispatched.

-> The latest taxi to arrive at the station joins the queue at the end.

-> No taxis leaves the queue once it joins the end untill it reaches the front and is dispatched.
